                    I was fortunate enough to have him as my track coach during high school.  
                    In those years, he went above and beyond to not only push me to be the best athlete I could be, but also formed a connection that went far beyond the track. 
                     Coach O’Riley is a fantastic coach and even a better person.”

                     I was looking to be as prepared as possible going into my first preseason playing college soccer.  
                     Soccer is a game where running mechanics are vital throughout the competition. Coach not only helped sharpen my form but enhanced my sprinting entirely.  
                    He emphasized the preparation and execution of fundamentals before and after a race.  
                    I fell in love with the sport while at the same time succeeding and learned more about my specific events”.
